        <h2>IT Systems – Digital Integration</h2>

        <p>
          Led the evaluation, deployment, and optimization of IT tools supporting
          service operations, reporting, and operational visibility. Extensive
          experience aligning digital systems with real operational needs,
          ensuring that technology enables—not complicates—service delivery.
        </p>

        <p>
          In parallel, designed and delivered multi-region telecommunications
          projects, coordinating technical standards, vendors, and operational
          constraints across different geographies. This experience strengthened
          the ability to integrate network infrastructure, IT systems, and
          service operations into cohesive, scalable solutions.
        </p>

        <p>
          Worked closely with technical, digital, and operational teams to ensure
          structured handovers between design, implementation, and operations,
          reducing friction and enabling stable, scalable service models.

        <h2>Performance Management & Data-Driven Decisions</h2>

        <p>
          Strong background in defining, governing, and operationalizing KPIs and
          SLAs to measure service quality, operational efficiency, and regulatory
          compliance. Designed reporting frameworks and dashboards that translate
          operational data into clear, actionable insights for both management
          and frontline teams.
        </p>

        <p>
          Applied data analysis and automation using SQL, Python, and Power BI to
          support performance monitoring, identify improvement opportunities,
          and drive informed, evidence-based decision-making across service
          operations.

          documentation aligned with ISO 9001 and ISO 27001 standards. Actively
          supported internal and external audits, ensuring continuous compliance
          and sustained readiness for recertification processes.
        </p>

        <p>
          Embedded quality management and information security principles into
          daily operational workflows, ensuring that compliance is achieved
          through consistent execution rather than treated as a one-time or
          purely administrative exercise.
